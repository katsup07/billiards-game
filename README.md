# Simple Billiards

This project is a very simple top-down billiards game written in plain HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click and drag on the white cue ball to aim your shot, then release to strike. Balls bounce off the cushions and can be sunk in the six pockets.

## Development

No build tools are required. To verify the script is valid JavaScript you can run:

```
node --check script.js
```
