# Simple Billiards

This project is a very simple top-down billiards game written in plain HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click and drag on the white cue ball to aim your shot, then release to strike. Balls bounce off the cushions and can be sunk in the six pockets. The scoreboard tracks how many solids and stripes have been pocketed. If the cue ball is sunk it reappears at the starting position. Sink all of your stripes and then the 8 ball to win; if the 8 ball is pocketed early the solid team wins.

Use the **Reset** button above the table to clear the scores and rerack the balls. The game is centered in a dim billiards room complete with chairs, tables, bottles and even a jacket tossed over a chair to set the mood.

## Development

No build tools are required. To verify the script is valid JavaScript you can run:

```
node --check script.js
```
