The scoreboard tracks how many solids and stripes have been pocketed. If the cue ball is sunk it reappears at the starting position. Sink all of your stripes and then the 8 ball to win; if the 8 ball is pocketed early the solid team wins.

Use the **Reset** button above the table to clear the scores and rerack the balls. The game is centered in a dim billiards room complete with chairs, tables, bottles and even a jacket tossed over a chair to set the mood.
